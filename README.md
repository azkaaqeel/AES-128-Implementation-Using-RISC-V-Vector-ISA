# AES-128-VeeR-ISS

This project implements the AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm using the vector extension of the RISC-V instruction set architecture. AES-128 is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that secures data by converting plaintext into ciphertext using a 128-bit key.
